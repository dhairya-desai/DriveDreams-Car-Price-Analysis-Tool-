We traveled to Mongolia by car, a journey spanning over 8,000 miles that generated huge levels of publicity and sponsorship for our cause.

With no previous automation architecture in place and a brand new product to work on I started with a clean slate. The automation suite, code named 'Road Runner', has evolved from a basic regression test to incorporate data import and verification, boundary testing, destructive testing and sanity checks for overnight builds. The suite is deployed across a wide range of virtual environments that are hosted on a VMWare ESXi HyperVisor server. Utilising the TestNG framework and Selenium's RemoteWebDriver allows tests to be run against as many browser variants and versions on as many host operating systems as is required.
